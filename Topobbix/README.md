# Topobbix

Topobbix is a simple PHP script that generates a network topology based on the dependencies between the triggers of a given host group.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to use the PHP script in your Zabbix environment.

### Prerequisites

Currently the script works only in Zabbix environments that use the MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

The HTML code generated by the PHP script references an external javascript library. If your Zabbix Frontend does not have internet access, you should make a local copy of the javascript library and change the reference in the PHP script.

### Installing

Copy the PHP script to the document root of your Zabbix frontend.
For example, if you use CentOS 7, the document root directory is located in "/usr/share/zabbix".
